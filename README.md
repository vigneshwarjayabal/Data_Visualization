• Plotly: Explore interactive visualizations with Plotly, where users can zoom, pan, and hover over charts for detailed information.

3. Types of Visualizations 🔄
   
• Line Charts: Show trends and changes over time.

• Bar Graphs: Compare categorical data and visualize distribution.

• Histograms: Understand the frequency distribution of numerical data.

• Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between two continuous variables.

• Heatmaps: Visualize correlation and relationships between variables.

• Pie Charts: Show proportions of different categories.

• Donut Charts: Similar to pie charts but with a stylish hole in the center.

• Stacked Bar Charts: Compare multiple categories in stacked bars for easy comparison.


4. Real-World Example: Chennai Sales Dataset 🏙️
   
• This project uses the Chennai Sales Dataset to demonstrate various visualizations.


                                                Why Data Visualization? 🔍
Data visualization helps you quickly grasp the patterns, trends, and insights within a dataset. With the help of Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, data can be presented clearly and interactively. These visualizations can be crucial for:

• Making data-driven decisions.

• Presenting data insights to stakeholders.

• Uncovering patterns that may not be obvious in raw data.
